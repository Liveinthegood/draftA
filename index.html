    <p class="quoteboxDESK"> <img class="NativeStrengthLogo" src="images/NativeStrengthLogo1.png" alt="medicine wheels -circle of life  - picture"><span class="pro">WHAT IS NATIVE STRENGTH?</span> Native Strength is a centuries-old inter-tribal traditional mental health care system.  It uses medicine wheels, teaching triangles, and traditional stories to illustrate concepts and provide useful tools for personal insight and coping strategies.</p>


    <p class="bodytext"> <span class="pro">THE BEGINNINGS:</span> After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman <span class="proX">(Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans)</span>, and a Hawaiian Kahuna. These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures.</p>

    <img class="picture3" src="images/medicinewheelcirclesoflife_words.jpg" alt="medicine wheels -circle of life  - picture">

    <p class="bodytext">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies. As Hypatia began to teach the many things she had learned from the elders, it became apparent that this information was just as useful to the members of the Lost River band as it had been to her.</p>






            <!-- FOUNDER OF NATIVE STRENGTH, MAYBE A QUOTE BOX HERE AS I CALL IT -->


    <p class="quotebox">Hyapatia knew sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world would help heal many who were suffering. It would be a crime to withhold knowledge that could help others to live a better life.  </p>
